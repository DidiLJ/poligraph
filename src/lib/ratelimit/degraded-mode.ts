/**
 * Degraded-mode policy for the rate-limit middleware (Lot 3A).
 *
 * When Upstash is not configured the middleware cannot rate limit. This module
 * holds the pure decision logic so the behaviour is explicit and unit-tested:
 *
 * - development / preview: allow through, light throttled log, no fail-closed;
 * - production: allow through (so an Upstash outage never blocks the whole site
 *   nor locks operators out of admin), but emit a throttled alert and fail the
 *   `export` tier closed. `export` is the one heavy abuse / scraping vector with
 *   no operator dependency, so blocking it during an outage is safe and bounded.
